# 3-RRS-Parallel-Manipulator
This project implements the design, coding, and construction of a 3-RRS (Revolute–Revolute–Spherical) parallel manipulator capable of balancing a ball on a moving platform using PID control.

The system integrates mechanical design, control algorithms, and real-time experimentation to demonstrate precision motion and stability.
